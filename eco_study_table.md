Furthermore, marginal cost pricing generally == zero cost pricing.                                                              | UK Government (HM Treasury & Dept for BERR commissioned study) | 6 UK case studies, direct value                  | Professors D Newbery, L Bently & R Pollock (Cambridge University)                    | 2008 | Particularly in the cases of Ordnance Survey (geo-spatial), Land Registry, Companies and Driver Licensing data, above marginal (zero) cost pricing found to be highly distortionary. However, for the latter three, a 'two-part' tariff could be used to efficiently recover initial fixed costs (i.e. registration fees) |
